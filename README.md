# Sparse-Matrix-Multiplication
A class assignment from my Programming Fundamentals C++ Class. 

This was a fun exercise. At the core, we were somewhat creating a linked list despite not knowing its importance. 
Data, function headers, and driver were given by the Professor.

Because the data and driver was given, this sparse matrix multiplication program only works with the fixed MATRIX_SIZE = 18.
A potential optimization in the future would just be to add some cin / cout statements to allow this matrix program to work on any user-inputted matrices.
